"""
Multistart Variable Neighbourhood Hillclimbing (VNH) Algorithm

This algorithm attempts to solve a CNF SAT problem using a **multistart variable neighbourhood hillclimbing** approach:

1. **Multistart:** Repeatedly starts from random initial solutions until either the global optimum
   is found or a maximum number of evaluations is reached.
2. **Variable Neighbourhood:** Explores the neighborhood of the current solution by flipping `k` bits simultaneously.
   - `k` starts at 1 and increases up to a maximum (`max_k = 3`) if no improvement is found.
   - If an improving neighbor is found, moves to it immediately and resets `k` to 1.
3. **Next-Ascent Hillclimbing:** Visits neighbors in combinatorial order and moves to the first neighbor
   that improves fitness (number of satisfied clauses).

Key Points:
- Fitness = number of satisfied clauses in the CNF formula.
- Evaluations count the total number of fitness computations performed.
- Stops early if the global optimum is found.
- Combines multistart, variable neighborhood, and greedy hillclimbing to escape local optima.
