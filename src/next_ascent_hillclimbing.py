"""
Next-Ascent Hillclimbing Algorithm (1-bit Hamming Distance)

This algorithm attempts to solve a CNF SAT problem using stochastic local search.
It implements the **Next-Ascent Hillclimbing** strategy:

1. Starts from a random initial solution (0/1 assignments for each CNF variable).
2. Explores the neighborhood at Hamming distance 1 (flipping one bit at a time).
3. Moves immediately to the first neighbor that improves the fitness
   (number of satisfied clauses).
4. Repeats until no improving neighbor is found (local optimum)
   or the global optimum (all clauses satisfied) is reached.

Key Points:
- Fitness is the number of clauses satisfied by the current assignment.
- Evaluations count the number of fitness computations performed.
- Neighbors are visited in random order to introduce stochasticity.
