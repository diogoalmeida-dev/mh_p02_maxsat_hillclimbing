Variable Neighbourhood Hillclimbing (VNH) Algorithm

This algorithm attempts to solve a CNF SAT problem using a local search strategy
with **variable neighbourhoods**:

1. Starts from a random initial solution (0/1 assignments for each CNF variable).
2. Explores the neighborhood of the current solution by flipping `k` bits simultaneously,
   where k starts at 1 and can increase up to a maximum (here k=3).
3. If an improving neighbor is found, moves immediately to it and resets k to 1.
4. If no improvement is found, increases k to explore a wider neighborhood.
5. Stops when a global optimum is found (all clauses satisfied) or all neighborhoods
   have been explored without improvement (local optimum).

Key Points:
- Fitness is the number of satisfied clauses in the CNF formula.
- Evaluations count the number of fitness computations performed.
- Uses combinatorial generation of neighbors at Hamming distance k.
- Combines a greedy hillclimbing approach with a variable neighborhood strategy
  to escape small local optima.
