"""
Multistart Next Ascent Hillclimbing Algorithm (1-bit Hamming Distance)

This algorithm attempts to solve a CNF SAT problem using a stochastic local search.
It combines two strategies:
1. Next-Ascent Hillclimbing: explores the 1-bit Hamming distance neighbourhood of a solution,
   moving to the first neighbor that improves fitness (number of satisfied clauses).
2. Multistart: repeats the hillclimbing process from multiple random initial solutions
   until either a global optimum is found or a maximum number of evaluations is reached.

Key Points:
- Each solution is represented as a list of 0/1 assignments for the CNF variables.
- Fitness is the number of clauses satisfied by the solution.
- Evaluations count the number of fitness computations performed.
- Stops early if the global optimum (all clauses satisfied) is found.
